    "In the first subquery you wrote, you created a table that you could then query again in the FROM statement. However, if you are only returning a single value, you might use that value in a logical statement like WHERE, HAVING, or even SELECT - the value could be nested within a CASE statement.\n",

    "Note that you should not include an alias when you write a subquery in a conditional statement. This is because the subquery is treated as an individual value (or set of values in the IN case) rather than as a table.\n",

    "Also, notice the query here compared a single value. If we returned an entire column IN would need to be used to perform a logical argument. If we are returning an entire table, then we must use an ALIAS for the table, and perform additional logic on the entire table."
