    "PostgreSQL’s documentation does an excellent job of introducing the concept of Window Functions: \n",
    "\n",
    "*** a window function performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. ***\n",
    "\n",
    " This is comparable to the type of calculation that can be done with an aggregate function. But unlike regular aggregate functions, use of a window function does not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row — the rows retain their separate identities. Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through introducing [window functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/tutorial-window.html), we have also introduced two statements that you may not be familiar with: OVER and PARTITION BY. These are key to window functions. Not every window function uses PARTITION BY; we can also use ORDER BY or no statement at all depending on the query we want to run. You will practice using these clauses in the upcoming quizzes. If you want more details right now, [this resource](https://blog.sqlauthority.com/2015/11/04/sql-server-what-is-the-over-clause-notes-from-the-field-101/) from Pinal Dave is helpful.\n",

    "The partitioning component, expressed as PARTITION BY, is optional and is supported for all types of window functions. Partitioning divides up the rows. It’s kind of like a physical window that is divided up into panes. The entire window is a window. The panes are also windows. Say that I partition by CustomerID. The partition for CustomerID 1000 is restricted to rows for CustomerID 1000.  For the calculation on any given row, the window consists of rows from that partition only. This means that the ROW_NUMBER function restarts the row numbers for each partition, for example. You can specify more than one column for PARTITION BY as long as you separate the columns with commas. Partitioning is not the same as grouping with the GROUP BY clause. When you use the GROUP BY clause, only one row is returned for each group. Partitioning is just a way to divide the data in order to perform the calculations; the detail columns are returned. \n",

    "Ordering within the OVER clause is supported when the data must be sorted to perform the calculation. For example, ROW_NUMBER requires an ORDER BY expression within the OVER clause because the rows must be lined up. Actually, most of the window functions support ORDER BY.  ORDER BY in the OVER clause is not supported for calculating subtotals, for example. You don’t need the data sorted to calculate a sum. Note that the ORDER BY within the OVER clause has nothing to do with an ORDER BY clause found in the query itself. Just like partitioning, you can specify a comma delimited list of columns. Figure 2 shows the results of ORDER BY in the OVER clause.\n",

    "The third component of the OVER CLAUSE is called framing. Framing was introduced with SQL Server 2012 and is used in only a couple of situations: accumulating window aggregates (running totals, moving averages, etc.) and the functions FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE. While partitioning is similar to window panes, framing is like a stained glass window. When performing the calculations, every row might see a different set of rows through the window. For example, when calculating a running total, row 1 sees row 1. Row 2 sees rows 1 and 2. Row 3 see rows 1, 2, and 3. The syntax for framing is a bit complex, so I am going to save it for my next post. By default, the frame consists of the first row of the sorted partition and all subsequent rows up to the current row.  Figure 3 is an example. The small arrows represent the current row where the calculation is being performed.\n",

Since all rows are tied, this means the entire partition is included, no matter which row is \"current.\"\n",
